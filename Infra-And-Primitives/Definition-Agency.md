# Agency

## Definition & Overview

### Primary Definition (Human-Accessible)
**Agency** is the capacity to recognize what you genuinely want and take coherent actions toward it, even when circumstances change. It begins with authentic desire—the internal motivating factor that differentiates agency from merely responding to external pressures or expectations.

### Systems Definition (Technical)
**Agency** is a system's ability to instantiate and preserve the possibility of transformation over time and context. It represents the capacity to maintain optionality and adaptive potential across varying conditions while pursuing desired outcomes.

## Significance within AgentSee
- Agency is foundational to AgentSee's philosophy and vision, forming the core principle that all systems, tools, and frameworks seek to amplify.
- It represents the core outcome AgentSee aims to systematically engineer—creating explicit structures and technology that enhance and support genuine human desire-driven action.
- The dual definition bridges human experience with technical implementation, enabling both relatable understanding and precise system design.

## Core Distinctions & Boundaries
- **Explicitly distinct from**:
  - **Autonomy**: Merely the freedom or lack of constraint; does not inherently involve desire or transformation capacity.
  - **Motivation**: Can be internal or external; agency explicitly prioritizes intrinsic desire and preserves future possibilities.
  - **Discipline**: Requires autonomy, motivation, and willpower; agency is more foundational, beginning with desire and maintaining adaptive capacity.
  - **Empowerment**: External enablement; agency is internally generated, though empowerment can enhance agency.
  - **Self-efficacy**: Belief in one's capability; closely related but not identical—agency involves acting on desire while preserving transformation possibilities.

- **Boundary Conditions**:
  - Requires **self-awareness**—explicit awareness and recognition of personal desires and states.
  - **Continuum**: Agency exists along a spectrum from low to high, rather than being binary. All humans possess some level of agency.
  - **Constructor Theory Foundation**: Agency operates through physical transformations that are possible given the laws of physics and available knowledge, distinguishing between what can and cannot be constructed in reality.

## Examples & Applications
- **Primary Level**: Choosing career paths or projects that align with one's internal interests and desires rather than externally imposed societal expectations or pressures.
- **Systems Level**: Maintaining the capacity to pivot strategies when circumstances change while preserving core objectives—like adapting methods while maintaining direction.
- **Constructor Theory Application**: Building knowledge and tools that expand what transformations become possible in your life, rather than just executing predetermined plans.

### Practical Application within AgentSee:
- Developing reflective systems that explicitly prompt users to articulate desires clearly.
- Creating contextual preference-mapping systems designed to clarify internal desires and conflicts.
- Building systems that preserve optionality and adaptive capacity rather than locking users into rigid paths.
- Designing tools that maintain transformation possibilities across changing contexts and timescales.

## The Agency-Coherence Bootstrap
Agency and coherence exist in a mutually reinforcing relationship:
- **Minimal coherence** enables initial acts of agency (recognizing and acting on authentic desires)
- **Acts of agency** increase internal coherence by aligning actions with desires
- **Increased coherence** enables more sophisticated agency across broader contexts
- **Enhanced agency** deepens coherence through repeated aligned action

This bootstrap process explains how small initial improvements in either domain can generate expanding spirals of capability and integration.

## Clarifying Questions & Open Issues
- How can agency be measured or quantified along the continuum in practical applications?
- What are the biological, cognitive, or environmental factors that most significantly amplify or limit agency?
- How does the relationship between constructor theory's "what's possible" and personal agency's "what's desired" inform tool design?
- What interventions most effectively support the agency-coherence bootstrap process rather than targeting either in isolation?
