# Agency

## Definition & Overview
- **Agency** is the human individual's capacity to **recognize internal desires**, intentionally choose goals aligned with those desires, and consistently take coherent actions toward their fulfillment.
- It explicitly begins with authentic **desire**—the internal motivating factor or "itch" that differentiates agency from merely acting upon external pressures or influences.

## Significance within AgentSee
- Agency is foundational to AgentSee's philosophy and vision, forming the core principle that all systems, tools, and frameworks seek to amplify.
- It represents the core outcome AgentSee aims to systematically engineer—creating explicit structures and technology that enhance and support genuine human desire-driven action.

## Core Distinctions & Boundaries
- **Explicitly distinct from**:
  - **Autonomy**: Merely the freedom or lack of constraint; does not inherently involve desire.
  - **Motivation**: Can be internal or external; agency explicitly prioritizes intrinsic desire.
  - **Discipline**: Requires autonomy, motivation, and willpower; agency is more foundational, beginning explicitly with desire.
  - **Empowerment**: External enablement; agency is explicitly internally generated, although empowerment can enhance agency.
  - **Self-efficacy**: Belief in one's capability; closely related but not identical—agency explicitly involves acting on desire regardless of perceived ability.

- **Boundary Conditions**:
  - Requires **self-awareness**—explicit awareness and recognition of personal desires and states.
  - **Continuum**: Agency explicitly exists along a spectrum from low to high, rather than being binary. All humans possess some level of agency.

## Examples & Applications
- **Example**: Choosing career paths or projects that explicitly align with one's internal interests and desires rather than externally imposed societal expectations or pressures.
- **Practical Application within AgentSee**:
  - Developing reflective systems that explicitly prompt users to articulate desires clearly.
  - Developing systems that analyze possible implicit desires recognized and prompting users with this knowledge. 
  - Creating contextual preference-mapping systems explicitly designed to clarify internal desires and conflicts, thus supporting clearer agentive actions.

## Clarifying Questions & Open Issues
- How explicitly can agency be measured or quantified along the continuum?
- What are explicit biological, cognitive, or environmental factors that most significantly amplify or limit agency?
- How does explicit self-awareness training enhance measurable agency outcomes?
