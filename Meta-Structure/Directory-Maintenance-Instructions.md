# Directory Structure Maintenance Instructions

## Purpose
This document provides instructions for maintaining an accurate representation of the AgentSee Knowledge Base directory structure. It ensures that the Project Structure documentation stays in sync with the actual filesystem and maintains consistency across the knowledge base.

## Directory Structure Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Hierarchical Organization**: Each directory serves a specific purpose in the knowledge ecosystem
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Distinct categories for different types of content
3. **Scalable Structure**: Designed to accommodate growth while maintaining clarity
4. **Consistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions across all directories

### Directory Purposes
- **Questions-Index/**: Core philosophical and practical questions
- **Worklog/**: Chronological record of thoughts and developments
  - raw/ - Unprocessed thoughts and observations
  - insights/ - Processed and refined thoughts
  - decisions/ - Key decision points and rationale
  - artifacts/ - Generated outputs and deliverables
- **Frameworks/**: Original conceptual models and frameworks
- **Mental-Models/**: Borrowed or adapted cognitive tools
- **Infra-And-Primitives/**: Core definitions and terminology
- **Research-And-Quotes/**: External concept references and research
- **Experiments/**: Active testing and iteration
- **AAT-Writing/**: Internal and external versions of concepts
- **Tech-Stacks/**: Technical implementation details
- **Meta-Structure/**: Documentation about the knowledge base itself

## Naming Conventions

### Files
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Include date prefix for time-sensitive content (YYYY-MM-DD-)
- Use descriptive, purpose-indicating names
- Avoid special characters except hyphens

### Directories
- Use Pascal-Case for directory names
- Keep names concise but descriptive
- Use plural form for directories containing multiple items
- Maintain consistent capitalization

## Implementation Notes
- This document should be updated whenever the maintenance process changes
- The maintenance process should be automated where possible
- Regular audits should be performed to ensure documentation accuracy
- Consider using git hooks for automated structure validation
- Maintain a changelog of structural modifications
