### Title:
**Andreessen's Desire Vectors**

### Summary:
Marc Andreessen describes human desires and motivations as directional vectors, shaped profoundly by social environments and technological contexts. These vectors don't just express existing human wants—they actively shape and guide future desires and behaviors.

### Key Ideas:
- **Directional Motivation**: Desires guide behavior along paths influenced by societal norms, technologies, and media.
- **Technological Mediation**: Technologies amplify, channel, and shape human desires, creating new demand vectors.
- **Social Construction**: Social interactions and norms influence which desires are valued and pursued.

### Notable Quotes:
- *"Desire vectors aren't simply personal; they're constructed and amplified by society and technology."*
- *"Technology doesn't merely satisfy existing desires—it actively reshapes and directs human motivation."*

### Relevance to AgentSee:
- Clarifies how technological design can intentionally shape user motivations and desires.
