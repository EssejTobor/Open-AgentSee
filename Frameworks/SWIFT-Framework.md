# SWIFT: A Coherence-Agency Bootstrap Framework
_A framework for sustainable motivation and adaptive momentum through coherent exploration_

---

## Purpose
**SWIFT resolves the fundamental problem of motivation collapse in complex, uncertain environments where traditional goal systems fail.**

Most goal frameworks (like SMART goals) assume stable preferences, predictable environments, and sustained willpower—assumptions that break down in complex reality. SWIFT provides an alternative that creates sustainable momentum by leveraging intrinsic curiosity, rapid feedback cycles, and the coherence-agency bootstrap process. It can be used as a heuristic or as a framework. It replaces rigid planning with adaptive exploration, transforming the experience from willpower-depleting to naturally engaging.

---

## First Principles
- **Coherence-agency reciprocity**: Coherence and agency exist in a bootstrap relationship where each enables and reinforces the other, creating virtuous cycles of improvement.
- **Motivation is a dynamic system**, not a fixed trait that can be manipulated directly.
- **Curiosity generates its own momentum** when properly channeled, serving as a self-renewing energy source.
- **Predictive efficiency** is a core driver of brain function, with systems organized to minimize prediction error while optimizing energy expenditure.
- **Learning velocity** matters more than execution perfection in complex, uncertain environments.
- **Internal alignment** creates more sustainable action than externally imposed discipline or willpower.
- **Reality feedback** is the ultimate arbiter of progress, trumping pre-planned metrics or subjective evaluations.

## Components

### S = Speed (of Learning & Iteration)
- **Definition**: The velocity at which feedback is gathered and incorporated, prioritizing rapid cycles of action-learning-adjustment over perfect execution.
- **Operational mechanism**: Creating minimal viable experiments, reducing friction in testing cycles, and minimizing the delay between action and feedback.
- **Theoretical neurobiological basis**: Optimizes dopaminergic learning signals by increasing the frequency of prediction-outcome pairs, strengthening neural pathways through repeated activation and adjustment.
- **Signals of function**: Quick adjustment to new information, comfort with imperfection, continuous movement toward objectives, escalating competence.
- **Signals of breakdown**: Analysis paralysis, perfectionism blocking progress, excessive planning relative to action, lengthy feedback delay loops.

### W = Wonder (Intrinsic Curiosity Gradient)
- **Definition**: Following genuine interest and curiosity as the primary navigation system, leveraging intrinsic motivation rather than external pressure.
- **Operational mechanism**: Attending to natural cognitive attraction, pursuing questions that genuinely spark interest, and exploring areas of epistemic tension.
- **Theoretical neurobiological basis**: Engages intrinsic reward circuitry associated with information-seeking and novelty, activating opioid and dopaminergic systems that create sustainable motivation patterns.
- **Signals of function**: Sustained engagement without external rewards, absorption in tasks, natural time expansion during exploration, spontaneous questioning.
- **Signals of breakdown**: Forced interest, quick disengagement, clock-watching, motivation requiring external reinforcement, mechanical execution.

### I = Intrinsic Value (Authentic Alignment)
- **Definition**: Ensuring actions align with genuine personal values and interests rather than externally imposed shoulds or social expectations.
- **Operational mechanism**: Regular re-evaluation of whether activities resonate with authentic desires, adjusting approaches to enhance intrinsic motivation, and connecting tasks to meaningful personal narratives.
- **Theoretical neurobiological basis**: Creates coherence between the Default Mode Network (self-reference) and task execution networks, reducing cognitive dissonance and minimizing the metabolic cost of self-regulation.
- **Signals of function**: Energization from activities, narrative coherence between values and actions, reduced need for willpower, natural prioritization.
- **Signals of breakdown**: Depletion from supposedly valued activities, internal resistance, value-action gaps, misalignment between stated priorities and attention allocation.

### F = Factful Flexibility (Adaptive Understanding)
- **Definition**: Maintaining a commitment to reality-based models while remaining flexible enough to update them based on new evidence.
- **Operational mechanism**: Active testing of assumptions, explicit tracking of changing perspectives, and continuous refinement of mental models based on empirical feedback.
- **Theoretical neurobiological basis**: Optimizes Bayesian belief-updating processes, balancing prior confidence with new evidence through appropriate precision-weighting of prediction errors.
- **Signals of function**: Willingness to be wrong, proportional belief updating, decreased surprise over time, increasingly accurate predictions.
- **Signals of breakdown**: Confirmation bias, perseverance of disproven beliefs, excessive certainty, reality distortion to preserve existing models.

### T = Test Rapidly (Experimental Mindset)
- **Definition**: Approaching actions as experiments designed to generate useful information rather than immediately achieve perfection.
- **Operational mechanism**: Framing initiatives as hypothesis tests, designing for maximum learning per unit of effort, and systematically extracting insights from both successes and failures.
- **Theoretical neurobiological basis**: Reframes "failure" as valuable prediction error signals, reducing threat responses and enhancing learning through recategorization of outcomes as information rather than judgment.
- **Signals of function**: Decreased failure aversion, explicit hypothesis formation, information-focused outcome evaluation, consistent experimentation.
- **Signals of breakdown**: Excessive caution, binary success/failure framing, avoidance of uncertain domains, reluctance to expose ideas to reality testing.

## Internal Interactions

### Primary Component Relationships
1. **Speed × Wonder**: Rapid iteration amplifies curiosity by quickly revealing interesting patterns and questions
2. **Wonder × Intrinsic Value**: Following curiosity naturally leads to activities aligned with authentic interests
3. **Intrinsic Value × Factful Flexibility**: Authentic motivation enables honest reality assessment without ego-protective distortion
4. **Factful Flexibility × Test Rapidly**: Reality-based models enable more effective experiment design
5. **Test Rapidly × Speed**: Experimental mindset reduces friction in learning cycles, increasing iteration velocity

### Agency-Coherence Bootstrap Process
The SWIFT framework operates as a coherence-agency bootstrap engine:
- **Initial coherence** between curiosity (Wonder) and action (Test Rapidly) enables small acts of agency
- This agency creates **feedback** that enhances coherence between mental models (Factful Flexibility) and reality
- Increased coherence enables **greater agency** in selecting aligned activities (Intrinsic Value)
- This expanded agency accelerates learning (Speed), further enhancing system-wide coherence
