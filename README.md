# AgentSee Knowledge Base

Building the Bell Labs for human well-being - systematic research into human agency in the age of AI.

## What's Here

**Frameworks** - SWIFT (alternative to SMART goals), Narrative Alignment Model (how beliefs become actions become reality), Motivation Stack (why willpower fails)

**Core Definitions** - Agency, coherence, caring, intrinsic motivation, positive interdependence - rigorous definitions that actually mean something

**Mental Models** - Allostasis and predictive load, Bayesian-Frequentist coherence, evolutionary preference systems

**Research** - Desire vectors, focusing methods, narrative self and default mode network

## Why This Matters

World complexity is outstripping human cognitive capacity. AI is accelerating this. Most people are fracturing under the load. We need cognitive infrastructure that enhances human agency rather than replacing it.

This isn't self-help. It's engineering applied to human cognition.
