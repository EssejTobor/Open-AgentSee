# AgentSee Knowledge Base

> **“I’m not building a product. I’m building the lab that figures out what should exist.”**

This is the **living knowledge base** behind [AgentSee](https://againstdeclivity.substack.com), a first-principles research project exploring how to systematically enhance **human agency** in an age of algorithmic acceleration.

What you'll find here:
- Foundational definitions of agency, coherence, motivation, and internal conflict
- Experimental frameworks like [SWIFT](./Frameworks/SWIFT-Framework.md), the [Narrative Alignment Model](./Frameworks/Narrative Alignment Model.md), and [Positive Interdependence](./infra-And-Primitives/Definition-Positive-Interdependence.md)
- Personal essays that show the thinking-in-process
- Conceptual scaffolding for future cognitive infrastructure tools

What this is **not**:
- A finished product
- A coaching system
- A generic productivity method

AgentSee is building the **Bell Labs for human well-being**—a lab for mental models, experimental scaffolds, and decision-support tools that *respect human complexity and aim to enhance it*.

### ✍️ Author
I'm Jesse. No degrees. 20+ years of self-directed learning while painting houses. I’ve built this out of necessity—because no one else was building what I needed. And I’m doing it publicly, because the kind of world I want to live in demands better infrastructure for human cognition and growth.

### 🧠 Why Publish This?

Because agency isn’t granted—it’s bootstrapped.  
And knowledge that isn’t shared can’t compound.

This repository is part lab notebook, part philosophy, part operating manual for a project still becoming itself. You’re welcome to study it, build on it, or just reach out and talk about it.

Let’s make being human work better.
