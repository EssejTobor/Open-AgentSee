### Title:
**Bayesian-Frequentist Coherence**

### Summary:
Bayesian-Frequentist coherence integrates Bayesian subjective belief updating with Frequentist objective empirical validation. It models cognitive processes as iterative loops, continuously refining subjective beliefs (priors) using empirical (objective) feedback.

### Key Concepts:
- **Subjective Priors:** Bayesian belief updating based on personal insights, knowledge, and experience.
- **Objective Validation:** Frequentist statistical evaluation of outcomes through empirical evidence.
- **Iterative Updating:** Continuous looping of Bayesian updates informed explicitly by Frequentist empirical data.

### Notable Quotes:
- *"Beliefs must be continuously updated by reality checks."*
- *"Optimal reasoning involves both subjective intuition and objective empiricism."*

### Relevance to AgentSee:
- Provides an explicit methodological framework for agent-driven learning loops.
- Aligns subjective user beliefs with objective performance data.
- Enhances user coherence by rigorously aligning internal motivations with external reality.
