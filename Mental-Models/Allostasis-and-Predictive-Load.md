## Title:
**Allostasis and Predictive Load**

## Summary:
Allostasis describes the adaptive process by which the body anticipates future demands and adjusts physiological systems accordingly. Predictive load refers to the cognitive and physiological strain incurred when managing uncertainty, complexity, and prediction errors.

## Key Concepts:
- **Allostatic Regulation:** Continuous predictive adjustments in physiological and cognitive systems for stability through change.
- **Predictive Load:** The cognitive and biological cost of managing predictions, expectations, and uncertainties.
- **Chronic Overload:** Persistent predictive load causing stress, cognitive exhaustion, and reduced adaptive capacity.

## Notable Quotes:
- *"Brains are prediction machines constantly striving for anticipatory homeostasis."*
- *"Persistent prediction errors create cumulative allostatic burdens, impairing cognitive and emotional regulation."*

## Relevance to AgentSee:
- Highlights necessity of cognitive load minimization in user experience design.
- Reinforces the significance of accurate predictive modeling to maintain user agency and coherence.
- Suggests targeted interventions reducing predictive load and supporting adaptive resilience.
